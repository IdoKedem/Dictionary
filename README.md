# Dictionary
This program was created on August 2020

(1) This program takes 2 inputs from the user.
Every pair of inputs are saved in a Python dictionary after selcting "Save to dictionary", the upper input being the 'key' and the lower one being the 'value'.

(2) After selecting "Start practicing", Python randomizes the dictionary and shows the first randomized key.

(3) The program will ask the user to input the matching value to the key, AKA the input (value) they gave earlier.
If the value matches the key, the next key will show.
Else, a message will pop up, asking if you would like to reveal the answer and acts accordingly.

(4) After cycling through the whole dictionary, another message will pop up, asking if you would like to restart.
If user selects "Yes", the dictionary will be re-randomized and will repeats stages (2) - (4).
Else, the program exits.
